#### Parameterizion of rational switching function to montonically scale each element in PIV from 1 to 0.

Radial distribution fucntion between each atom type pair can be used for determining `R_0` and `MM` in SWITCH arguments. Typically, for a proper scaling between 1 and 0, the center point in RDF corresponding to the peak in case of a unimodal distribution or between the peaks in case of multimodal (most common is bimodal) distribution is a good choice. To help obtaining reasonable values for `R_0` and `MM` in the rational switching function, [parameterize_switching_functions.py](parameterize_switching_functions.py) can be used mainly for solute-solute blocks.
